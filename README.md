# User sandbox \( [Live demo on Heroku](https://sign-in-sandbox.herokuapp.com) \)
a simple Rails 5 implementation of basic user authentication and authorization using Devise gem.

Prerequisite (have these installed):
- ruby 2.5.1
- rails 5.2.1
- Postgresql

First-time starting app? Do this:
```
git clone git@github.com:christophwong/user-sandbox.git
cd user-sandbox
rails db:setup
rails server
```
Now you have started up the app! Let's go check it out by typing the following in your terminal:
```
open http://localhost:3000
```
or open a web browser of your choice and go to http://localhost:3000


Now what does this app do?
It is a starting point for experimenting with different authentication models.
